# Do-Redistricting-Commissions-Reduce-Gerrymandering

Abstract:     
A growing number of states have implemented commissions in order to design political districts, in large part as a response to concerns about partisan gerrymandering. While a significant amount of work endorses the use of independent redistricting commissions in theory, very little research has analyzed the causal effects of implementing redistricting commissions. In this paper, I contribute to our understanding of the role redistricting institutions play in gerrymandering outcomes by evaluating how Arizona's independent redistricting commission affected gerrymandering outcomes in congressional elections. To this end, I examine election outcomes in Arizona between the years of 1982 and 2016; two full redistricting cycles before the commission was implemented, and over one and a half redistricting cycles afterward. I use a novel variant of the synthetic control method, a recently popularized empirical tool for generating plausible control groups when none naturally exist, to facilitate this analysis. I find some suggestive evidence that commission-based redistricting in Arizona may have reduced partisan gerrymandering. While my baseline results fall short of full statistical significance, there is also no evidence that Arizonaâ€™s redistricting commission made partisan gerrymandering outcomes worse; at a minimum, it seems to have done no harm where gerrymandering is concerned.
